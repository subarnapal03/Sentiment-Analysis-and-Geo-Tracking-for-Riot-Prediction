# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Geo-Tracking-for-Riot-Prediction
The "Sentiment Analysis and Geo-Tracking for Riot Prediction" project combines natural language processing and geolocation technologies to analyze public sentiment and track potential sources of unrest. By leveraging a pre-trained RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis, the system evaluates the sentiment of user-submitted texts to identify negative sentiments that could indicate social unrest. Additionally, the project captures the IP addresses of users to determine their geographical locations, providing valuable context for the sentiment data. This combination of sentiment analysis and geo-tracking allows for real-time monitoring of public sentiment across different regions, enabling authorities and organizations to identify and respond to potential riot hotspots effectively. The project aims to enhance public safety by proactively predicting and mitigating the risk of riots through data-driven insights
